# Basic Keras code for Alexnet and VGG-16
## Here you can use these nets as feature extractors for images.
The codes hosted here were used for my masters degree project. Here, these neural networks were used fo feature extraction from images. Each net was trained on images sourced from VEDAI dataset for aerial imagery. The end result is a neural net to identify vehicles from aerila imagery.
